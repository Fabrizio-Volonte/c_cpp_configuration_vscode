# c_cpp_configuration_vscode

task.json and launch.json configurations to run and debug c and c++ in VSCode.
Download the files and put them inside a ".vscode" folder inside the folder of your c or c++ program;

Important note: They are (currently) specifically for Linux, at the moment I tested them just with that.  
I might add configurations for Windows in the future.
